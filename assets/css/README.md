# HOW TO build css


I'm using Bootstrap with Sass in this project and if you want to create the CSS files there are a few little things you need to do.

1. Get and Install nodejs from, https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Install SASS about a terminal, **npm install -g sass**
3. Build css with, **sass --watch assets/scss:assets/css**

Done :-)
